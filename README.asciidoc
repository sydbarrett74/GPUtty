= GPUtty - YATE (yet another terminal emulator)

Based on Kovid Goyal's kitty (see https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/ for more information). Forked so that I can experiment with adding features Kovid has expressed unwillingness to implement. Also, I'm open to seekng feature parity with PuTTY and KiTTY.
